Sahrdaya Map
This repo contains code that contain the map of Sahrdaya college of Engineering 

I'm using several concepts and platforms for Sahdaya Map

 1. Dijkstra Algorithm

Dijkstra algorithm is used to solve the shortest path problem.Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is a generalization of the BFS algorithm. The regular BFS algorithm cannot solve the shortest path problem as it cannot guarantee that the vertex at the front of the queue is the vertex closest to sources.This algorithm is based on edges and verices.Through this we can find the shortest distance from various vertices(places).

 2. Google Cloud Platform

For making a better API under Google resources,Google Cloud Platform is an inevitable one.for example to make youtube API under Kodi Application we have to need Youtube v3 API.Likeways for making a map for getting the shortest distance we have to need enabling Map API under Google Libraries in Google Cloud Platform and we have to get an unique id called API Key for running interface according to our needs like website,mobile applications etc

Google API Key

Disadvantages : 
Sometimes we have to buy packages for better enhancement


3. Github

GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.It gives a lot of options for help developers build and design software.

This shows directions under google map between two locations.We can see a option for start point and end point.we can select several locations according to our needs.

select any options like:

Result:

But in our there is occured because I have tried several times with several API keys but google says that I have to buy the google cloud platform for $300 dollars. ie, 21,969.54 Indian Rupees. I stopped my current project due to this issue.

My Result:

Options thus be like:

I will resolve these problems accoring to my situvations.
